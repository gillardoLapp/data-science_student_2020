# Data Science course 2019 - Homework


1. Setup a working directory
2. Download the data (2GB)
```
pip install kaggle
kaggle competitions download -c new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction
```
note: if you don't have a kaggle account, the dataset will be copied during the lecture.


**Note:**
The files might be too large to copy to the working space `E://`     
In this case, copy the files on the Desktop.
In the notebook you can access them through the path:
`D:/Users/username/Bureau/`


3. Start a notebook
    - open the `train.csv` file - find the option to limit the number of rows if the file is too large
    - explore the dataset: make some graphs, explain what is inside the file
    - apply everything we have seen together
    
4. Train a model for fare prediction
    - choose the features to use
    - choose a model
    - apply what we saw in the `Supervised` notebook

5. Submit your notebook to github making a pull request
    - create a github account
    - fork this repository
    - clone the fork on your local environment
    - `git add`
    - `git commit`
    - `git push` on your remote
    - make a pull request
